Aim :

To develop a Python program to find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers.



Algorithm :

STEP 1: Start the program by importing math.

STEP 2: Get the input for num1 and num2.

STEP 3: Use math. gcd to find the gcd of num1 and num2 gcd=math.gcd(num1,num2)

STEP 4: Print the gcd.



Flow Chart :

    import math
    num1=int(input("num1="))
    num2=int(input("num2="))
    gcd=math.gcd(num1,num2)
    print("GCD of",num1,"and",num2,"is",gcd)
