Aim:

To develop a Python program to find the sum of square of individual digits of a number using function

Algorithm :

STEP 1: Initialize sum_of_squares to 0.

STEP 2: Start a while loop with the condition number > 0.

STEP 3: Within the while loop, find the last digit of the number by taking the modulo 10 of the number and assign it to the variable digit.

STEP 4: Calculate the square of the digit using the expression digit ** 2 and add it to the sum_of_squares.

STEP 5: Update the number by integer division with 10.

STEP 6: Continue the loop until number is no longer greater than 0.

STEP 7: Return the value of sum_of_squares.
