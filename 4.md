Aim:

To develop a Python program using function to compute the factorial of a given number.

Algorithm :

STEP 1: Start

STEP 2: Read the input number from the user

STEP 3: Declare and initialize variables fact = 1 and i = 1

STEP 4: Repeat the loop until i<=num

fact = fact * i

i = i++

STEP 5: Print fact to get the factorial of a given number

STEP 6: Stop

Flow Chart:

    n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
    fact=1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
	    fact=fact*i
    print("The factorial of",n,"is",fact)
